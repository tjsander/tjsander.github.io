I started wearing a watch four years ago, about the time when everyone else stopped. As a teacher time management was very important to my job, and it was not appropriate to use my cellphone during class time. I bought a Casio F-105W (THE ILLUMINATOR) for about 1200 JPY, and it's been a permanent fixture on my wrist ever since.

The Casio F105W-1A has a three-button UI. It tells time in 24H or 12H. It has an alarm and a stopwatch. It's water resistant. The killer app is a green-glowing backlight.

In my opinion, it's the best value watch ever made. (Currently $11.50 on Amazon.)

The recently-announced Apple Watch is extremely cool -- and I'm almost certainly going to buy an Apple Watch 2 or an Apple Watch 3 if the 2 is also expensive -- but I was hoping for something that had half of these features for half of the price.

I don't need to be able to see my friends' baby picture posts to Facebook on my wrist. I don't want anyone I'm dating to ever, EVER send me their heartbeat. That's creepy as hell.

Basically, I want a Casio F105W that shows my push notifications and tracks my fitness.

>[STEAL THIS IDEA] An activity monitor that you can attach to the bottom of a watch.

From a design perspective, the Apple Watch dial is a stroke of pure genius. The device casing is jewelery that I would actually wear. The curved, flexable display is impossible.

It looks a lot like a small, polished 2G iPhone. It will probably sell similar numbers. Possibly more. Maybe people are just used to throwing down $400+ for some new thing they didn't know they needed but now must absolutely have.

I was almost certain Apple would include a wireless charging pad or some sort of ingenious method for motion charging. Nightly charging seems like a cruel joke. I don't want to have to charge my watch more than twice a week. Or ever. The battery in the Casio I bought 4 years ago is still going strong.

The world needs early adopters, but I'm just not one of them. Remember when the iPad was a new thing and you saw that douchebag with the iPad in a coffee shop? Are you not that douchebag now?

I'd like to preemptively thank everyone who is going to purchase the Apple Watch for funding the Apple Watch 2.
