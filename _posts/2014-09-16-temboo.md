### Third-party APIs are not easy/fun to work with


From what little web-development experience I have, I can tell that learning new APIs can be a complicated, frustrating process. There doesn't seem to be a universal access procedure, and the quality of documentation varies greatly.

Temboo is a cloud-based service that handles all of the API mess for you. With over 100 APIs and 1000+ "Choreos" (calls to receive specific information), Temboo is a powerful tool to quickly and easily retrieve information from otherwise complicated third parties.

The following is a simple demonstration of how to retrieve and display tweets based on a search query.

### Access your Twitter API keys


Log in to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) using your Twitter ID.
Click Create New App and fill in the required information.
Inside of the app you created, navigate to API Keys and make sure you have access to API key, API secret, Access token and Access token secret.

Normally, at this point, you would dig through the dev.twitter.com documentation to figure out how to make a proper AJAX call as well as deal with the OAuth procedure, what sort of information the call would return, and how to parse that information.

Using Temboo greatly simplifies this process.

### Setup Temboo

[Sign up](https://temboo.com/signup) for a Temboo account.
[Download](https://temboo.com/sdk/php) the Temboo PHP SDK and unzip it to your project folder.
To include the library, simply add the following line to your php: `require 'php-sdk/src/temboo.php';`
Now, navigate to Temboo . Library . Twitter . Search . [Tweets](https://temboo.com/library/Library/Twitter/Search/Tweets/) to auto-generate php, or copy the code below and fill in your Temboo and Twitter API keys.
You can find your Temboo access information [here.](https://temboo.com/account/applications/)

{% highlight PHP startinline=true %}
$session = new Temboo_Session("YOUR_USERNAME", "TEMBOO_APPNAME", "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY");
$tweets = new Twitter_Search_Tweets($session);

// Get an input object for the Choreo
$tweetsInputs = $tweets->newInputs();

// Set inputs
$tweetsInputs->setCount("1-200")->setAccessToken("CHANGEME")->setQuery("SEARCH_TERM")->setAccessTokenSecret("CHANGEME")->setConsumerSecret("CHANGEME")->setConsumerKey("CHANGEME");

// Execute Choreo and get results
$tweetsResults = $tweets->execute($tweetsInputs)->getResults();

// Parse JSON response
$results = json_decode($tweetsResults->getResponse());

// Get statuses array
$statuses = $results->statuses;
{% endhighlight %}

### Displaying the returned information


After the above code, an array of Tweets and associated information is stored in $statuses and can be accessed like any other PHP array. From there, it's a simple matter of looping through the elements in the statuses array, collecting the information you wish to print, and formatting the output to your liking. There's even a Temboo Choreo to easily store JSON responses to a MySQL database.

The [Temboo library](https://temboo.com/library/Library/Twitter/Search/Tweets/) where the code was generated contains a sample JSON response to this choreo, which can be copied and pasted into a [JSON Editor](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/) for easy navigation and searching to find the Tweet attributes you wish to use.

The elements we're interested in are stored at `$statuses[$index]->text` and `$statuses[$index]->user->screen_name`

There's plenty out there on [formatting Twitter strings to look pretty,](http://tutorialzine.com/2011/08/display-favorite-tweets-php-css/) but that's outside of the scope of this writeup.

{% highlight PHP startinline=true %}
for ($i=0; $i<10; $i++) {
	// Get first status
	$status = $statuses[$i];

	// Get the text object within the first item
	$text = $status->text;

	// Get the screen name within the first item
	$user = $status->user->screen_name;
	echo $user . ': ' . $text;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Running the 'php' command on your file in the command line should produce results that look like this:

![](/assets/images/console_bat.png)

>If there are any authentication errors, they should show up in your console. Check your API keys and regenerate if necessary.

Throw that php into a panel with some fancy Bootstrap CSS, and you've got yourself a pretty good-looking display of tweets.

### Conclusion

Temboo free accounts are limited to 1000 calls and 512 MB a month, so I wouldn't recommend it for sites that receive a lot of hits or applications that are going to be making more than 1 call every 30 minutes on average, unless you're willing to pay $10/month for 10,000 calls. Just playing around with my simple app, I ran up 91 calls in a couple of days with testing.

I'm currently using php session caching to reduce the number of calls the #batfleck code makes. In fact, the Twitter REST API documentation states that Twitter limits search queries to 180 per 15 minutes and recommends caching to avoid limitations.
