I recently completed a second bachelors degree in computer science. I am looking for an opportunity to put my new skills to work and get a taste for many different areas of software development. I am especially interested in embedded/wearable systems and the intersection of embedded and big data.

I have always been fascinated with the way things work, and I take everything I own apart. 

I enjoy constructing complex systems using simple, elegant language and seeing them work.

I pay attention to small details.

I want to solve your problems and find new ones.
